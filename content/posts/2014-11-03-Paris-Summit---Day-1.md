Hooray Paris!

Well, maybe. Having only seen the inside of the conference center and hotel lobby of the hotel nextdoor, I didn't get to do much summiting today. Rather, the day was spent prepping for tomorrows workshop.

I do hear that the #vBrownBags are doing extremely well with 19 individual sessions recorded (and streamed?) today, and a [full schedule](http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalk-schedule-at-openstack-summit-paris-2/) of 100-ish more this week.
