It's the holidays WOOOOO! Well, maybe no seven O's woo, but still, a good time nevertheless. On the Zen moments thing, about 6 years ago, my father told me [this story](http://commuteorlando.com/wordpress/2009/02/03/a-zen-master-asks-why-ride-a-bicycle/), and designed the sticker you see above.

The story:

>Five students of a Zen master was back from the market on their bicycles. As they dismounted, their master asked: "Why are you riding your bicycles?” 
> 
>Each of them came up with different answers to their master’s query. 
> 
>The first student said: “It is the bicycle that is carrying the sack of potatoes. I am glad that my back has escaped the pain of bearing the weight.”
> 
>The master was glad and said: ”You are a smart boy. When you become old you will be saved of a hunch back unlike me.” 
> 
>The second student had a different answer: ”I love to have my eyes over the trees and the sprawling fields as I go riding.” 
> 
>The teacher commended: “You have your eyes open and you see the world.” 
> 
>The third disciple came up with yet a different answer: ”When I ride I am content to chant ‘nam myoho renge kyo’”>

>The master spoke words of appreciation: ”Your mind will roll with ease like a newly trued wheel.” >

>The fourth disciple said: “Riding my bicycle I live in perfect harmony of things.” >

>The pleased master said: ”You are actually riding the golden path of non-harming or non violence.”>

>The fifth student said: ”I ride my bicycle to ride my bicycle.” >

>The master walked up to him and sat at his feet and said: “I am your disciple!”

Having ridden a bicycle for a number of years, I have used it for various means and in various phases. Weight-loss, transportation, racing, harmony with nature, etc. However, over the last several years through varied events, dramas and the like, I have learned that in cycling: "I ride because I ride."

If you also ride because you ride, and would like a sticker, either email me (bunchc at gmail) or ping me on twitter and we can arrange something.
