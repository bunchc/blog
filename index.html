      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-10-15-ZeroVM---Some-Background'> ZeroVM - Some Background</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Wed, Oct 15, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>In a little over three weeks, at the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-paris-summit-2014/">Paris Summit </a>, I&rsquo;ll be helping give a 90 minute workshop on <a href="http://zerovm.org/">ZeroVM</a>. 90 minutes is not actually a lot of time to get a good grasp on what ZeroVM is, how it operates, and most importantly, <em>why</em> it is important.</p>

<p>These next few posts however, I am hoping, will shed some light on that.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">What is ZeroVM?</h2>

<p>From the ZeroVM website:</p>

<pre><code>ZeroVM is an open source virtualization technology that is based on the Chromium Native Client (NaCl) project. ZeroVM creates a secure and isolated execution environment which can run a single thread or application
</code></pre>

<p>Read that over a few times. What it is saying, is where Docker provides packaging, traditional virtualization provides full OS isolation, ZeroVM provides an environment specific to a single application or thread.</p>

<p>Explained another way, ZeroVM provides isolation at the thread or application level. It provides a &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; environment for you to run arbitrary &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; code. Some examples of how this could be useful can be found <a href="http://play.golang.org/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">here</a>.</p>

<p>ZeroVM does this by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">NaCL from Google</a> to provide isolation and security. ZeroVM also has a number of other layers that provide additional services for things like a Posix filesystem, I/O, and channels.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Use Cases</h3>

<p>Due to the small size, speed, and isolation nature of ZeroVM, it is able to solve some problems that are very &ldquo;big data&rdquo; or cloud centric. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/drill/">Apache Drill</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.zerovm.org/en/latest/zerocloud/overview.html">ZeroCloud</a>

<ul>
<li>More on that <a href="http://openstack.prov12n.com/getting-started-with-zerovm/">here</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">Where Does ZeroVM Fit?</h2>

<p>This diagram from the Atlanta OpenStack Summit should help:</p>

<p><img src="http://openstack.prov12n.com/screens/Using_ZeroVM_and_Swift_to_Build_a_Compute_Enabled_Storage_Platform_-_YouTube_2014-10-13_14-00-42.jpg" alt="ZeroVM vs Traditional Virt" />
</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR1RUSdUQCs#t=424">this</a> OpenStack Summit presentation should help clarify some as well.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Traditional Virtualization</h3>

<p>Traditional Virtualization is perhaps the easiest to cover, it&rsquo;s the most familiar way of isolating the things. I&rsquo;ve been running VMware Workstation/Fusion, their enterprise products, etc for <em>ages</em>. I imagine a lot of you have as well. To recap tho:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type 1 or 2 hypervisor</li>
<li>Each VM is a set of processes</li>
<li>CPU instructions virtualized (it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated now-a-days with Hardware extensions)</li>
<li>Carries around a full OS installation</li>
<li>All resources isolated</li>
<li>Very few <em>published</em> VM escapes</li>
</ul>

<p>A few clarifying points. I&rsquo;ve simplified the CPU bits for this discussion. That is, while hardware extensions provide native or near native execution, there is still quite a bit that happens in software for those instructions that don&rsquo;t translate. Additionally, the &ldquo;all resources isolated&rdquo; is a bit of a simplification as well. Most modern hypervisors will do some manner of memory sharing, compression, and consolidation. That said, one VMs memory still belongs only to that VM.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Containers (Docker / LXC)</h3>

<p>Containers are all the rage these days. Docker has popularized and simplified the way we manage them. You get the same or better benefit from the shared hardware, however, containers strip quite a few of the layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shared Kernel / OS</li>
<li>Super low overhead</li>
<li>Fast startup</li>
<li>&lsquo;secure&rsquo;</li>
<li>Managed via namespaces and process isolation</li>
</ul>

<p>The important bits to note here, are the shared Kernel bits and the low overhead. The shared Kernel basically means everyone will run from the same Linux Kernel, and thus have the same features and limits therein. However, as an upside to that, you also shed having to carry around a full OS installation, networking stack, etc, and thus have much less overhead. This enables faster startup times and a potentially smaller attack surface.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">ZeroVM</h3>

<p>Finally, and most important to what we&rsquo;re talking about are the ZeroVM bits. ZeroVM is somewhere a bit beyond containers. That is you still have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shared hardware</li>
<li>Low Overhead</li>
<li>Fast Startup</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you are no longer carrying an OS or Kernel around. In turn, this further minimizes the attack surface. That is, there are a total of 6 system calls available from within ZeroVM.</p>

<p>In addition, due to it&rsquo;s extremely small size one can spin up a new ZeroVM instance in miliseconds, vs seconds or minutes for the other technologies. This speed advantage lends itself well to one of ZeroVMs primary use cases in the data-pipeline / data-processing space. Indeed it is the magic that makes Zero Cloud work. It does, however, require a different way of thinking about and approaching the problem.</p>

<p>That is, ZeroVM instances are designed to be extremely temporary in nature. Load your data in, handle the processing, push it back out to disk (if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after) and move on. Conceptually, it takes you a few steps further down the &lsquo;everything is disposable&rsquo; path, in that you will need to design and rewrite your apps to work with ZeroVM.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Summary</h2>

<p>While a wall of words, I hope I have provided some clarity around the what of ZeroVM and the Where it fits.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-10-14-Instance-Shelving'> Instance Shelving</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Tue, Oct 14, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>Shelving? No no no, not that kind of shelving. Similar however. Image Shelving in Nova allows you to power off instances without experiencing the resource penalty in keeping them around.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Instance Shelving</h2>

<p>Before instance shelving in OpenStack, if a user powered down an instance, the resources would still be in use on the compute node that housed said instance. Quite wasteful, no? Say an instance is powered off for 72+ hours. Shelving allows you to keep all the various bits associated with the VM while moving it to somewhere that is not the hypervisor to conserve resources.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Working with Shelving</h2>

<p>The assumption here is that you have either devstack or some other flavor of OpenStack running. There isn&rsquo;t anything additional you need to configure to make this work.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s log into our controller and look around at what&rsquo;s running:</p>

<pre><code># nova list
+--------------------------------------+-------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name  | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks                                      |
+--------------------------------------+-------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 05617907-3931-414f-88f3-fd180f69fde6 | test1 | ACTIVE | -          | Running     | cookbook_network_1=10.200.0.2, 192.168.100.11 |
+--------------------------------------+-------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s shelve an instance:</p>

<pre><code># nova shelve test1
</code></pre>

<p>Did it get shelved?</p>

<pre><code># nova list
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name  | Status            | Task State | Power State | Networks                                      |
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 05617907-3931-414f-88f3-fd180f69fde6 | test1 | SHELVED_OFFLOADED | -          | Shutdown    | cookbook_network_1=10.200.0.2, 192.168.100.11 |
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The change in status to &ldquo;SHELVED_OFFLOADED&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s unshelve it &amp; check status:</p>

<pre><code># nova unshelve test1
# nova list
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name  | Status            | Task State | Power State | Networks                                      |
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 05617907-3931-414f-88f3-fd180f69fde6 | test1 | SHELVED_OFFLOADED | spawning   | Shutdown    | cookbook_network_1=10.200.0.2, 192.168.100.11 |
+--------------------------------------+-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>There we go!</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we worked with one of the new-ish features in Nova, instance shelving. Good for when you need to stop instances for a long time in a non-impactful way.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-10-13-Running-Rackspace-Private-Cloud-on-the-Rackspace-Public-Cloud'> Running Rackspace Private Cloud on the Rackspace Public Cloud</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Mon, Oct 13, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>Private Cloud on the Public Cloud? As odd as that sounds, or as inception as it makes you feel (Clouds in clouds?!), I&rsquo;ve found that since downsizing my homelab quite a bit, I&rsquo;ve needed to find other ways to work on and try out various things that exceed the capacity of my laptop. RPC 9 is one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I work for Rackspace, and while this post is largely focused around two of our products, I put it out here in the hopes that a) someone will find it useful, and b) it&rsquo;ll help me later.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Rackspace Private Cloud (RPC)</h2>

<p>Our docs will do it a lot more justice in terms of description than I can, so I encourage you to go <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v9/bk-rpc-installation/content/index.html">here</a> and take a few minutes to get familiar.</p>

<p>A few things I want to point out are related to the architecture of RPC9, specifically:</p>

<p><img src="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v9/bk-rpc-installation/content/figures/1/a/a/a/rpc-common/figures/rpc9-environment-overview.png" alt="RPC Infrastructure" />
</p>

<p>Looking over the diagram, there are a <em>lot</em> of hosts involved now. 3x Infrastructure nodes, a logging host, n-Compute hosts, deployment hosts, and finally a set of load balancers. This thing is big. Bigger than my laptop that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Running Cloud on Cloud</h2>

<p>Thankfully, however, while it&rsquo;s big, the folks who wrote this provided some OpenStack Heat templates that make setting it up externally much easier. Those can be found <a href="https://github.com/rcbops/ansible-lxc-rpc/tree/master/scripts">here.</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Getting Started</h3>

<p>To build the cloud on the cloud you&rsquo;ll need the following info &amp; apps installed somewhere you have access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>An &ldquo;heatrc&rdquo; or similar file containing

<ul>
<li>Rackspace Username</li>
<li>Rackspace API Key</li>
<li>Endpoint(s) to deploy to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Python-HeatClient</li>
<li>An SSH Key</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the &ldquo;heatrc&rdquo; file, start with the below template and then edit as needed:</p>

<pre><code>export OS_USERNAME=rackspace_cloud_username
export OS_PASSWORD=rackspace_cloud_password
export OS_TENANT_ID=rackspace_cloud_account_number
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/
export HEAT_URL=https://ord.orchestration.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1/${OS_TENANT_ID}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> OS_TENANT_ID is your cloud account number. You can get to this by logging into mycloud.rackspace.com and clicking your account name in the upper right.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created the file and replaced said values, install the Heat client: <code>pip install python-heatclient</code></p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Installing RPC 9 on the Rackspace Public Cloud</h3>

<p>To kick off the installation, follow these commands:</p>

<pre><code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcbops/ansible-lxc-rpc/master/scripts/rpc9.0.0-aio-rax-heat-template.yml &gt; rpc9-rax-heat.yaml

source ./heatrc

heat stack-create RPC9-Stack -f ./rpc9-rax-heat.yaml \
  -P image_name=&quot;Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)&quot; \
  -P ssh_key_name=&quot;lol_ssh_key&quot; \
  -P flavor_name=&quot;8 GB Performance&quot;

+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status       | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| c2b6c1b0-0098-441d-9999-c778b108a181 | RPC9-Stack | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2014-10-13T15:13:58Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+

</code></pre>

<p>This next part takes quite a bit of time to complete and is why we used a performance instance, to make the provision happen just a bit faster. You can keep an eye on it&rsquo;s build status with <code>watch -n 15 heat stack-list</code></p>

<p>Once it completes, you will need to find out what IP address it has been assigned, to do that, use these commands:</p>

<p>List the stacks:</p>

<pre><code>$ heat stack-list
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status    | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| c2b6c1b0-0098-441d-9999-c778b108a181 | RPC9-Stack | CREATE_COMPLETE | 2014-10-13T15:13:58Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>List the available outputs:</p>

<pre><code>$ heat output-list RPC9-Stack
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| output_key       | description                                           |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| RPCAIO_password  | The password for all the things.                      |
| RPCAIO_public_ip | The public IP address of the newly configured Server. |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Finally show the IP:</p>

<pre><code>$ heat output-show RPC9-Stack RPCAIO_public_ip
&quot;127.0.0.100&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_4">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post we showed you how to nest the Rackspace Private Cloud installation on the Rackspace Public Cloud. A useful trick for testing it out without having to use <em>ALL</em> your local resources up.</p>

<p>Oh Oh Oh! The lesson in book writing is that it is both terrible and addictive. That is, right as we wrapped the second edition of the OpenStack Cookbook, I promised myself &ldquo;Never again!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, some number of months later, <a href="https://twitter.com/itarchitectkev">Kevin</a> and myself, we&rsquo;ve chatted a bit, and have decided to go down that road to update the book again. Indeed, we&rsquo;re also looking at bringing <a href="https://twitter.com/eglute">Egle</a> along for the ride this time.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">3rd Edition Highlights</h2>

<p>The third edition will target either a late Juno or early Kilo release (Hooray Relevancy!). In addition to general updates, were adding or overhauling the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenStack Datacenter Automation</li>
<li>OpenStack Scaling</li>
<li>Image Management &amp; Conversion</li>
<li>More Operations Recipes</li>
<li>HTTPS!</li>
<li>OpenStack Heat</li>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-09-10-MariaDB-With-Galera-on-Vagrant'> MariaDB With Galera on Vagrant</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Wed, Sep 10, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>Found myself in some training this last week using MariaDB, and being that I like to get a bit more hands on than most, using the class provided lab environment wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. This meant wrapping some scripting into a Vagrant environment so I could reliably reporduce the three node lab.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Getting Started</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need Vagrant and Git. It&rsquo;s also preferred that you have vagrant-cachier installed. You should have vagrant-cachier anyways, but alas, that is not for right now. Once you have these out of the way, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/bunchc/mariadb-galera-vagrant.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd mariadb-galera-vagrant</code></li>
<li><code>vagrant up</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_1">Validating the Cluster</h2>

<p>After a few minutes, you should be able to log into any of the nodes. Specifically, node-01 will be used to &lsquo;bootstrap&rsquo; the cluster, the other two nodes will join from there.</p>

<p>To validate the cluster:</p>

<pre><code>vagrant ssh mariadb-02
sudo su -
mysql -uroot
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'wsrep%';
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to do the above from any of the nodes in the cluster.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-08-19-Raspberry-Pi-as-PXE-Server'> Raspberry Pi as PXE Server</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Tue, Aug 19, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>As I start to move from OpenStack Compute Cells in Devstack to OpenStack Compute Cells physicall, I needed to re-think my homelab some. It had been running some variation of vsphere and the OpenStack Cookbook work from various projects prior. Basically, it was a Hodor of a home lab.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Hodor!</h2>

<p>Rather than lose a bit of hardware to foreman, or one of the new razor forks (I may still go this route later), I decided instead to pound a Raspberry Pi into service. To turn the rPI into a usable provisioning server, I did the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provision a 16gb card with Raspbian</li>
<li>Beat Networking Into Submission</li>
<li>Setup IP Tables for Nat</li>
<li>Configure DHCP, PXE, TFTP, etc</li>
</ol>

<p>We&rsquo;ll skip step 1 as the folks at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberrypi.org</a> cover that pretty well already.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Beat Networking Into Submission</h2>

<p>So the rPI does some auto-hotplugging bits that can cause you some issues if you try to use both wifi and ethernet at the same time. If you&rsquo;re not expecting them, well&hellip; let&rsquo;s just say I spent too long trying to solve before googling the problem. Here&rsquo;s what my networking config files look like:</p>

<pre><code># cat /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auth eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 172.16.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    address 10.0.1.15
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 10.0.1.255
    gateway 10.0.1.1

iface default inet dhcp

# cat /etc/default/ifplugd
INTERFACES=&quot;eth0&quot;
HOTPLUG_INTERFACES=&quot;eth0&quot;
ARGS=&quot;-q -f -u0 -d10 -w -I&quot;
SUSPEND_ACTION=&quot;stop&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have that, reboot the rPI and you should be good to go.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Setup IP Tables for NAT</h2>

<p>This is also pretty well straight forward, but for some reason I end up googling it each time. Here it is for reference:</p>

<pre><code># NAT
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth0 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables.conf
iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.conf
sh -c &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&quot;
sed -i &quot;s/exit 0/iptables-restore &lt; \/etc\/\iptables.conf \nexit 0/g&quot; /etc/rc.local
sed -i &quot;s/#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/g&quot; /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_3">Configure DHCP, PXE, TFTP, etc</h2>

<p>This one is a bit more involved, but is all done via the following bash commands:</p>

<pre><code>MY_IP=$(ifconfig eth0 | awk '/inet addr/ {split ($2,A,&quot;:&quot;); print A[2]}')

</code></pre>

<p>The commands themselves are commented pretty well. Generically what they do is install dnsmasq for dhcp &amp; tftp. From there we download and extract all the things from the ISO that we&rsquo;ll need, configure some menus, download a basic preseed, and restart some services.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we took a lowly Raspberry Pi and indentured it into some network servitude as a pxe / tftp server. We did this by installing and configuring dnsmasq for tftp and dhcp. Additionally we set up some fancy pxeboot menus and configured them to boot locally as a priority and to the network in times of need. Finally, we pulled down an Ubuntu 14.04 image and generic preseed file to use for automatic installs.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-08-15-Vagrant-and-Hanlon-The-other-Razor-Fork'> Vagrant and Hanlon (The other Razor Fork)</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Fri, Aug 15, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>You may or may not know that Razor, the bare-metal lifecycle tool, has forked from its original bits. This is a good thing, but it&rsquo;s still really early days on the new forks, so we&rsquo;ll see ultimately what plays out.</p>

<p>The Puppet-Labs &ldquo;Razor-Server&rdquo; fork can be found <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server">here</a>. If you want to work with it, or test it locally, you can use the bits written by Egle <a href="http://anystacker.com/2014/01/vagrant-up-razor-server/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hanlon, the CSC fork <a href="https://github.com/csc/Hanlon">here</a>, is being perused by Tom McSweeney who helped get the original razor off the ground.</p>

<p>To help me work with it and contribute some, I&rsquo;ve built a small Vagrant environment (largely basd on the Vagrant environment for &lsquo;the other&rsquo; razor.).</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Vagrant Up Hanlon</h2>

<p>To get started, clone the repo and vagrant up, like so:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bunchc/vagrant-hanlon.git
cd vagrant-hanlon
vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>What this does during the vagrant up process is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install dnsmasq</li>
<li>Configure IPtables for NAT</li>
<li>Installs Mongodb</li>
<li>Installs Java</li>
<li>Installs RBENV</li>
<li>Installs both jruby and ruby 1.9.3</li>
<li>Downloads Hanlon</li>
<li>Starts Puma (to run Hanlon)</li>
<li>Pulls down a few images to add to Hanlon</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have Hanlon running, command wise it works very similar to the old Razor. That is:</p>

<pre><code>hanlon node
hanlon policy
hanlon image
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_1">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, you cloned and started to work with Hanlon, one of the derivatives of the Razor bare-metal provisioning framework.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-08-14-Updated-Blog--Markdown-workflow'> Updated Blog / Markdown workflow</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Thu, Aug 14, 2014</div>
    </header>

    

<p>A while ago I posted about my markdown <a href="http://openstack.prov12n.com/my-markdown-workflow-for-now/">workflow</a>. While that workflow was decent and worked for a goodly little while, it left quite a bit to be desired. Specifically, I the posting process into Wordpress was cumbersome at best.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">A New Blog Engine</h2>

<p>Like I said above, working with Wordpress and markdown was cumbersome and then some. So it was time for something new. At first I was going to use similar to <a href="https://github.com/chalupaul/chalupaul.github.io/">this</a>, which is actually what is in use on the <a href="http://openstackcookbook.com/">openstackcookbook.com</a> site. It has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Posts are written in Markdown</li>
<li>Integrated with gh-pages</li>
<li>Straighforward publishing process <code>git push origin master</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It was <em>almost</em> what I needed. In the end I went with <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/">Hugo</a>. What Hugo added was some pluggable themes and templates. Also the ability to run locally before pushing to github.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To setup Hugo on github, use <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/tutorials/github_pages_blog">this</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_1">Current Workflow</h2>

<p>My current workflow needed some help then. I kept the same sublime text plugins, that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>MarkdownEditing

<ul>
<li>This has a number of really handy keyboard bindings. It also has some decent highlighting and what not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Markdown Preview

<ul>
<li>This one allows me to go from Markdown into what it’ll look like on the web.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Markdown TOC

<ul>
<li>This lets me go from a basic set of sections and files into a more full fledged table of contents.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, to create a new post, I modified the Rakefile found <a href="https://github.com/chalupaul/chalupaul.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Rakefile">here</a>, to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'fileutils'
task :post do
    title = ENV['title'] || &quot;new-post&quot;
    tags = ENV['tags'] || ''
    make_img_dir = ENV['imgdir'] || false
    date = (ENV['date'] ? Time.parse(ENV['date']) : Time.now).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    filename = File.join('.', &quot;#{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}-#{title.strip.gsub(' ', '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '')}.md&quot;)
    open(filename, 'w') do |post|
        post.puts &quot;---&quot;
        post.puts &quot;title: \&quot;#{title}\&quot;&quot;
        post.puts &quot;date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}&quot;
        post.puts &quot;categories: &quot;
        post.puts &quot;---&quot;
        post.puts &quot;\nYour content here.&quot;
        if make_img_dir
            img_dir = File.basename(filename.chomp(File.extname(filename)))
            FileUtils.mkdir_p(&quot;../images/posts/#{img_dir}&quot;)
            post.puts &quot;\n&quot; * 5
            post.puts &quot;[imgdir]: /images/posts/#{img_dir}/&quot;
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So creating a new post goes like this:
bunchc: blog/content/posts$ rake post title=&ldquo;Title Here&rdquo;</p>

<p>In turn, that creates a YYYY-MM-DD-Title-Here.md file for editing in sublime. It also adds the metadata section at the top of the file for me:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Updated Blog / Markdown workflow&quot;
date: 2014-08-14
categories: 
---
</code></pre>

<p>From there, I write the file, save the file, and run <code>./deploy.sh</code> from the Hugo installer linked earlier. That handles all the pushing and bits to git.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Summary</h2>

<p>The gist of it is, Wordpress was a bit much and a bit heavy for what I needed. Hugo, Markdown, and GitHub Pages gave me a streamlined process that looks decent for posting.</p>
