    <p>Everything Jenkins does happens in the context of the jenkins user by default. While that sounds obvious, it has some interesting implications if you aren&#39;t careful. </p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>In my homelab, I&#39;ve installed 14.04 onto a 16gb usb key. This is a hold over from the days when it was an ESXi lab, but, it works for the most part. However, for things like downloading vagrant boxes and the like, one needs to mount external storage. Enter the problem: Jenkins sets itself up in /var/lib/jenkins by default, which lives on my very limited usb stick.</p>

<p>This in turn means anytime Jenkins tried to &#39;vagrant up&#39; a thing, it would fill my root partition trying to store all the temporary files vagrant used. Whoops.</p>

<h2>Changing the Jenkins Home Directory</h2>

<p>There are a number of posts out there on how to do this. None of them, however, addressed the vagrant issue in particular. To do that, one has to hit it with a larger bat.</p>

<h3>First Change /etc/defaults</h3>

<p>The first thing to do, is change how Jenkins thinks of itself. The most straight forward way I found was to change that in /etc/defaults/jenkins. This will be around line 23 or 25:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># jenkins home location
JENKINS_HOME=/new/location
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Then Change /etc/passwd</h3>

<p>This is the step that was needed to fix the problem of Jenkins running vagrant and vagrant subsequently filling /:</p>

<p>Change:
<code>jenkins:x:105:114:Jenkins,,,:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/bash</code></p>

<p>To this:
<code>jenkins:x:105:114:Jenkins,,,:/new/location:/bin/bash</code></p>

<h3>Finally Restart Jenkins</h3>

<p>Now to make sure all the things stick:</p>

<p><code>sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post we showed you how to change the Jenkins home directory, and why it&#39;s also important to change it in /etc/passwd.</p>

<h2>Building The ZeroCloud Lab</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a few ways of going about this, however before we get started, realize that this is still early days and if you find this post a few months or a year or two down the road, it will likely be super out of date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get working with ZeroCloud, the most straight forward path is to follow the directions in the ZeroVM Docs <a href="http://docs.zerovm.org/zerocloud/devenv.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve finished, you should have a functional ZeroCloud lab.</p>

<h2>Experimenting in the ZeroCloud Lab</h2>

<p>Having a lab up in running is one thing, but it&#39;s rather boring thing by itself. So, let&#39;s do something with it! </p>

<h3>ZeroCloud Hello World Example</h3>

<p>The first thing we&#39;ll try to do, is a generic &quot;Hello World&quot; example, taken from <a href="http://docs.zerovm.org/zerocloud/runningcode.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Log into the lab:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">vagrant ssh

cd devstack/
./rejoin-stack.sh
source /vagrant/adminrc

zpm auth
export OS_AUTH_TOKEN=PKIZ_Zrz_Qa5NJm44FWeF7Wp...
export OS_STORAGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/AUTH_7fbcd8784f8843a180cf187bbb12e49c
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to change the AUTH<em>TOKEN and STORAGE</em>URL values to match those returned by zpm auth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Create our &quot;Hello World&quot; python file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cat &gt; example &lt;&lt;EOF
#!file://python2.7:python
import sys
print(&quot;Hello from ZeroVM!&quot;)
print(&quot;sys.platform is &#39;%s&#39;&quot; % sys.platform)
EOF
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Now we run the example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">curl -i -X POST -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN&quot; \
  -H &quot;X-Zerovm-Execute: 1.0&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/python&quot; \
  --data-binary @example $OS_STORAGE_URL
</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, so what did we do then? In the first step we logged in to our lab, sourced a file that contains credentials for our environment, and then set some additional environment variables to store our auth token and swift url.</p>

<p>Next we created the hello-world example file. In the absence of a text editor we just dumped everything between &quot;&lt;&lt;EOF&quot; and &quot;EOF&quot; into the file &#39;example&#39;. Note the first line in the file begins with <code>#!file://</code>. This is important as it lets the parser know what to do with said file, in this case, fire up python.</p>

<p>Finally, we use curl against our Swift install, letting it know to jump out to the ZeroVM middleware and that our application type is python. Additionally we specify our entire program as the payload in <code>--data-binary</code></p>

<p>In this post, we showed you how to build a ZeroCloud lab and run an example &quot;Hello World&quot; application within it.

<p>Additionally, this <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/mapreduce-openstack-swift-and-zerovm">post</a> does a great job of explaining how ZeroVM fits when you start to approach middling to large (Read: <em>Big Data</em>) problems. Go read it now.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with ZeroCloud</h2>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve read the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/mapreduce-openstack-swift-and-zerovm">introduction by Lars</a>, and I trust that you have, we can start looking into the &#39;what&#39; of ZeroCloud. In this post we&#39;ll touch on it&#39;s architecture and use case or two. In a subsequent post we&#39;ll show you how to build your own small-scale lab for such an environment.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Also go here, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZU_4w_dCA">this</a>, around the 16:30 mark, pay attention to the &#39;t = data / Rate&#39; bits.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is where things in ZeroVM start to get really cool.</p>

<h3>ZeroCloud Architecture</h3>

<p>The best way to describe the what and how of ZeroCloud is with a few diagrams which we will then dive into. These are borrowed form slides in past presentations.</p>

<p><img src="http://openstack.prov12n.com/screens/1e1bd9b12a3230982c98-e2a0e10379dcd0e09ec354fba3ca6600.r72.cf1.rackcdn.comZeroCloud.pdf_2014-10-21_13-09-08.jpg" alt="Highlevel ZeroCloud Architecture"></p>

<p>This first diagram is a <em>hugely</em> simplified view of a swift environment, that is, if you have worked with OpenStack Swift it should look familiar enough. The &quot;Proxy&quot; nodes at the top are Swift Proxies, the Storage Nodes below are well, object storage nodes.</p>

<p>What changes for ZeroCloud is the addition of a few ZVM parts made available via Swift Middleware. In this case ZVM represents job brokers, some messaging, ZeroVM itself, as well as an &#39;executor&#39; that handles the connecting of channels and the reading / writing of objects in Swift. This next diagram breaks that down further:</p>

<p><img src="http://openstack.prov12n.com/screens/1e1bd9b12a3230982c98-e2a0e10379dcd0e09ec354fba3ca6600.r72.cf1.rackcdn.comZeroCloud.pdf_2014-10-21_13-10-12.jpg" alt="ZeroCloud Dataflow Architecture"></p>

<p>In this diagram, which admittedly is an eyechart, each step in the ZeroVM Swift Middleware is shown. Working left to right: </p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> The user initiates a job request via the Swift REST API by sending a post request with the code to be executed.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> This hits the Swift Proxy node and is handed to the ZeroVM middleware, which, via a job scheduler finds where the closest replica of your data is, and sends the request along.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> The job arrives at the executor who then fires up a net-new ZeroVM session for the job, opens the required IO Channels to your file* and if needed other ZeroVM sessions.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> The ZeroVM job, finished with it&#39;s work, sends the response back up to the Proxy Server who then serves the response back to the user.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> re: file in #3, in the default configuration this is a net new copy of the file rather than the actual object itself. This prevents accidental damage to the file.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>ZeroCloud Use Cases</h3>

<p>So what do you do with a deterministic, computable, distributed data store? Some things that jump to mind are things like &quot;A Giant MapReduce Cluster&quot;, similar to the one described <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/mapreduce-openstack-swift-and-zerovm">here</a>. As Lars describes, ZeroCloud can address one of the biggest MapReduce computational issues, that is data locality.</p>

<p>In addition to MapReduce type workloads, what else can one do? One could couple ElasticSeach and Log Stash, and indeed serve Kibana directly from Zero Cloud. Video trans-coding is another use case that I&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>ZeroVM/ZeroCloud then, works well when you have a data heavy workload that would benefit being attacked in a distributed fashion.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post we introduced you to ZeroCloud, the amalgamation of ZeroVM and OpenStack Swift. We dove into the architecture of ZeroCloud and introduced some use cases where having programmable distributed storage system is insanely useful.</p>

<h2>IO Operations in ZeroVM</h2>

<p>IO in ZeroVM is an odd sort of beast. As you are not working in a container or a VM you do not inherit the unlimited read/write to arbirtrary places as you would have otherwise. Instead the abstraction unit for ZeroVM is the <em>channel</em>.</p>

<h3>Channels</h3>

<p>As the intro said, a <em>channel</em> is the unit of IO abstraction within ZeroVM. That means any network communication, any file write, any input from a pipe, or output to swift, each is an individual channel. </p>

<p>Additionally, channels have to be explicitly defined prior to launching a ZeroVM instance. In some ways, this is like specifying the VMDK for a traditional VM to boot from. The requirement to specify all channels before hand does provide a powerful security mechanism in that all IO is effectively sandboxed. An erroneous process can not cause damage outside of the narrow constraints defined within said channel.</p>

<p>Channels in ZeroVM are unique in other ways. Each channel, regardless of type, is presented to the instance as a file handle. </p>

<h3>Channel Quotas</h3>

<p>To keep with the security and isolation provided within ZeroVM, along with the explicit channel definition, one must also specify a quota for IO. You specify said quota with four bits of information: (1) Total reads; (2) Total writes; (3) Total Read Size; and (4) Total Write Size.</p>

<p>Quotas are handled on a &#39;first one hit&#39; basis. So, if you have 10,000 reads to do, but said number of reads exceeds the total read size in bytes at read number 3,500, well, that&#39;s it. No more reads for you. The inverse of this is also true, when you run out of the number of allowed reads or writes before you hit the size quota, you will also get a failure returned.</p>

<p>When you do hit this limit, however, ZeroVM tries to fail gracefully, in that you will still have all the data read or written up to that point. Below is an example of what happens when you exceed the number of available reads:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/vagrant/file.txt bs=1048576 count=100

$ cat &gt; /home/vagrant/example.py &lt;&lt;EOF
file = open(&#39;/dev/3.file.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)
print file.read(5)
EOF

$ su - vagrant -c &quot;zvsh --zvm-save-dir ~/ --zvm-image python.tar --zvm-image ~/file.txt python @example.py&quot;

$ sudo sed -i &quot;s|Channel = /home/vagrant/file.txt,/dev/3.file.txt,3,0,4294967296,4294967296,0,0|Channel = /home/vagrant/file.txt,/dev/3.file.txt,3,0,3,3,3,3|g&quot; /home/vagrant/manifest.1
$ sudo sed -i &quot;s|/home/vagrant/stdout.1|/dev/stdout|g&quot; /home/vagrant/manifest.1
$ sudo sed -i &quot;s|/home/vagrant/stderr.1|/dev/stderr|g&quot; /home/vagrant/manifest.1

$ zerovm -t 2 manifest.1

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/dev/1.example.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    print file.read(5)
IOError: [Errno -122] Unknown error 4294967174
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is happening in that example is this:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Create a 100MB file full of random bits</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Create &#39;example.py&#39; to read the first 5 characters in the file</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Use zvsh to run example.py inside ZeroVM... this should dump some garbage characters to the console.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Change the quota from &#39;huge&#39; to 3</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Adjust the manifest file to allow stderr and stdout to work properly</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Run ZeroVM with the updated manifest &amp; receive IO error</p>

<h3>Specifying Channels in a Manifest File</h3>

<p>So that example took me way too long to figure out. Mostly due to a few small things and one big one: Creating the manifest file properly. What follows is a quick way to create a manifest file as well as our example manifest and a breakdown thereof.</p>

<h4>Creating a Manifest File</h4>

<p>It turns out that the zvsh utility that is bundled with ZeroVM has the ability to save the manifest (and other runtime files) when you launch it. To generate the template manifest that is used and modified in this example, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">zvsh --zvm-save-dir ~/ --zvm-image python.tar --zvm-image ~/file.txt python @example.py
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Breakdown of the Manifest File</h4>

<p>The example file that follows was for the specific bits used in our example. It can, however, make for a good starting point for your own manifest files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Node = 1
Version = 20130611
Timeout = 50
Memory = 4294967296,0
Program = /home/vagrant/boot.1
Channel = /dev/stdin,/dev/stdin,0,0,4294967296,4294967296,0,0
Channel = /dev/stdout,/dev/stdout,0,0,0,0,4294967296,4294967296
Channel = /dev/stderr,/dev/stderr,0,0,0,0,4294967296,4294967296
Channel = /home/vagrant/example.py,/dev/1.example.py,3,0,4294967296,4294967296,0,0
Channel = /home/vagrant/python.tar,/dev/2.python.tar,3,0,4294967296,4294967296,0,0
Channel = /home/vagrant/file.txt,/dev/3.file.txt,3,0,3,3,3,3
Channel = /home/vagrant/boot.1,/dev/self,3,0,4294967296,4294967296,0,0
Channel = /home/vagrant/nvram.1,/dev/nvram,3,0,4294967296,4294967296,4294967296,4294967296
</code></pre></div>
<p>Taken line by line:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Node</strong> an optional parameter specifying the node number.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Version</strong> mandatory. As manifest versions are incompatible. This tells both ZeroVM and you which version of the manifest you are using.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Timeout</strong> in seconds, is a mandatory parameter. This prevents long running ZeroVM jobs from consuming excess resources.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Memory</strong> Also mandatory, This is a comma separated value, where the first position is the 32-bit value representing memory. In our case, the max 4GB. The second number can be either 0 or 1 specifying the eTag used to checksum all data passing through ZeroVM</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Program</strong> Specifies the ZeroVM cross compiled binary that we will run</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Channel</strong> The channel definitions, these follow the format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Channel = &lt;uri&gt;,&lt;alias&gt;,&lt;type&gt;,&lt;etag&gt;,&lt;gets&gt;,&lt;get_size&gt;,&lt;puts&gt;,&lt;put_size&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post we covered how IO is handled in ZeroVM. We first explained the Channel concept, how quotas are handled within channels, and finally, how to add a channel or channels at ZeroVM runtime using a manifest.</p>
