<p>I found this morning I was in a bit of a blogging slump. That is, I&#39;d not posted anything in quite a while, even though I have plenty of exciting things going on at the moment. So, with that said, happening across <a href="http://etherealmind.com/challenge-30-blogs-30-days/">this post</a> by Greg Ferro (<a href="http://twitter.com/@etherealmind">@etherealmind</a>), I thought I&#39;d jump into the fray.</p>

<p>I encourage you to do the same.</p>
