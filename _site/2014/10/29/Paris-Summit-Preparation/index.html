<p>As you might have guessed from the large number of ZeroVM posts recently, that something was up. If you are going to be at the OpenStack Summit in Paris, there will be a ZeroVM workshop given by my coworkers <a href="https://twitter.com/eglute">Egle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/larsbutler">Lars</a>, and I.</p>

<p>This session will be a 90-minute, into the deep end, building applications to work with ZeroVM.</p>

<p>The materials, if you want to play along at home, can be found here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://4d01a92196a72e3b4215-657ddb0c96a24057e840f50c14fc13dd.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/ZeroCloud_Demo-07.ova">The ZeroCloud Appliance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.zerovm.org/zerocloud/snakebin/snakebin.html">The Online copy of the workshop</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Still missing are the slides and video which I will update the post with after the show. See you in Paris.</p>
