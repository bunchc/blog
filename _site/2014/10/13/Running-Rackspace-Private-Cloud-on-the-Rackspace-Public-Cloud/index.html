<p>Private Cloud on the Public Cloud? As odd as that sounds, or as inception as it makes you feel (Clouds in clouds?!), I&#39;ve found that since downsizing my homelab quite a bit, I&#39;ve needed to find other ways to work on and try out various things that exceed the capacity of my laptop. RPC 9 is one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I work for Rackspace, and while this post is largely focused around two of our products, I put it out here in the hopes that a) someone will find it useful, and b) it&#39;ll help me later.</p>

<h2>Rackspace Private Cloud (RPC)</h2>

<p>Our docs will do it a lot more justice in terms of description than I can, so I encourage you to go <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v9/bk-rpc-installation/content/index.html">here</a> and take a few minutes to get familiar.</p>

<p>A few things I want to point out are related to the architecture of RPC9, specifically:</p>

<p><img src="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v9/bk-rpc-installation/content/figures/1/a/a/a/rpc-common/figures/rpc9-environment-overview.png" alt="RPC Infrastructure"></p>

<p>Looking over the diagram, there are a <em>lot</em> of hosts involved now. 3x Infrastructure nodes, a logging host, n-Compute hosts, deployment hosts, and finally a set of load balancers. This thing is big. Bigger than my laptop that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<h2>Running Cloud on Cloud</h2>

<p>Thankfully, however, while it&#39;s big, the folks who wrote this provided some OpenStack Heat templates that make setting it up externally much easier. Those can be found <a href="https://github.com/rcbops/ansible-lxc-rpc/tree/master/scripts">here.</a></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To build the cloud on the cloud you&#39;ll need the following info &amp; apps installed somewhere you have access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>An &quot;heatrc&quot; or similar file containing

<ul>
<li>Rackspace Username</li>
<li>Rackspace API Key</li>
<li>Endpoint(s) to deploy to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Python-HeatClient</li>
<li>An SSH Key</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the &quot;heatrc&quot; file, start with the below template and then edit as needed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">export OS_USERNAME=rackspace_cloud_username
export OS_PASSWORD=rackspace_cloud_password
export OS_TENANT_ID=rackspace_cloud_account_number
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/
export HEAT_URL=https://ord.orchestration.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1/${OS_TENANT_ID}
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> OS<em>TENANT</em>ID is your cloud account number. You can get to this by logging into mycloud.rackspace.com and clicking your account name in the upper right.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve created the file and replaced said values, install the Heat client: <code>pip install python-heatclient</code></p>

<h3>Installing RPC 9 on the Rackspace Public Cloud</h3>

<p>To kick off the installation, follow these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcbops/ansible-lxc-rpc/master/scripts/rpc9.0.0-aio-rax-heat-template.yml &gt; rpc9-rax-heat.yaml

source ./heatrc

heat stack-create RPC9-Stack -f ./rpc9-rax-heat.yaml \
  -P image_name=&quot;Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)&quot; \
  -P ssh_key_name=&quot;lol_ssh_key&quot; \
  -P flavor_name=&quot;8 GB Performance&quot;

+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status       | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| c2b6c1b0-0098-441d-9999-c778b108a181 | RPC9-Stack | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2014-10-13T15:13:58Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
</code></pre></div>
<p>This next part takes quite a bit of time to complete and is why we used a performance instance, to make the provision happen just a bit faster. You can keep an eye on it&#39;s build status with <code>watch -n 15 heat stack-list</code></p>

<p>Once it completes, you will need to find out what IP address it has been assigned, to do that, use these commands: </p>

<p>List the stacks:
<code>
$ heat stack-list
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status    | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| c2b6c1b0-0098-441d-9999-c778b108a181 | RPC9-Stack | CREATE_COMPLETE | 2014-10-13T15:13:58Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
</code></p>

<p>List the available outputs:
<code>
$ heat output-list RPC9-Stack
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| output_key       | description                                           |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| RPCAIO_password  | The password for all the things.                      |
| RPCAIO_public_ip | The public IP address of the newly configured Server. |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
</code></p>

<p>Finally show the IP:
<code>
$ heat output-show RPC9-Stack RPCAIO_public_ip
&quot;127.0.0.100&quot;
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post we showed you how to nest the Rackspace Private Cloud installation on the Rackspace Public Cloud. A useful trick for testing it out without having to use <em>ALL</em> your local resources up.</p>
