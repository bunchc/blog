<p>Oh Oh Oh! The lesson in book writing is that it is both terrible and addictive. That is, right as we wrapped the second edition of the OpenStack Cookbook, I promised myself &quot;Never again!&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, some number of months later, <a href="https://twitter.com/itarchitectkev">Kevin</a> and myself, we&#39;ve chatted a bit, and have decided to go down that road to update the book again. Indeed, we&#39;re also looking at bringing <a href="https://twitter.com/eglute">Egle</a> along for the ride this time.</p>

<h2>3rd Edition Highlights</h2>

<p>The third edition will target either a late Juno or early Kilo release (Hooray Relevancy!). In addition to general updates, were adding or overhauling the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenStack Datacenter Automation</li>
<li>OpenStack Scaling</li>
<li>Image Management &amp; Conversion</li>
<li>More Operations Recipes</li>
<li>HTTPS!</li>
<li>OpenStack Heat</li>
<li>Additional Neutron Services (LBaaS, VPNaaS)</li>
<li>Using 3rd Party drivers</li>
</ul>
