<p>With the summit this week, I feel it&#39;s appropriate to announce that the <a href="https://github.com/openstackcookbook/openstackcookbook/tree/juno">scripts supporting the OpenStack Cookbook</a> have been updated (and are mostly functional) on OpenStack Juno.</p>

<p>To get started with them, you&#39;ll need either VMware Workstation/Fusion or Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Git.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">git clone https://github.com/openstackcookbook/openstackcookbook -b juno
cd openstackcookbook
vagrant up
</code></pre></div>
<p>These scripts will be updated and expanded once again as we being writing on the third edition of the OpenStack Cookbook.</p>
