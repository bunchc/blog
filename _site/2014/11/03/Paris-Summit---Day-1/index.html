<p>Hooray Paris!</p>

<p>Well, maybe. Having only seen the inside of the conference center and hotel lobby of the hotel nextdoor, I didn&#39;t get to do much summiting today. Rather, the day was spent prepping for tomorrows workshop.</p>

<p>I do hear that the #vBrownBags are doing extremely well with 19 individual sessions recorded (and streamed?) today, and a <a href="http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalk-schedule-at-openstack-summit-paris-2/">full schedule</a> of 100-ish more this week.</p>
