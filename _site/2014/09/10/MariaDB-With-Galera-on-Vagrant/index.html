<p>Found myself in some training this last week using MariaDB, and being that I like to get a bit more hands on than most, using the class provided lab environment wasn&#39;t going to cut it. This meant wrapping some scripting into a Vagrant environment so I could reliably reporduce the three node lab.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll need Vagrant and Git. It&#39;s also preferred that you have vagrant-cachier installed. You should have vagrant-cachier anyways, but alas, that is not for right now. Once you have these out of the way, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/bunchc/mariadb-galera-vagrant.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd mariadb-galera-vagrant</code></li>
<li><code>vagrant up</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Validating the Cluster</h2>

<p>After a few minutes, you should be able to log into any of the nodes. Specifically, node-01 will be used to &#39;bootstrap&#39; the cluster, the other two nodes will join from there.</p>

<p>To validate the cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">vagrant ssh mariadb-02
sudo su -
mysql -uroot
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE &#39;wsrep%&#39;;
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should be able to do the above from any of the nodes in the cluster.</p>
