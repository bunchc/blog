<p>A while ago I posted about my markdown <a href="http://openstack.prov12n.com/my-markdown-workflow-for-now/">workflow</a>. While that workflow was decent and worked for a goodly little while, it left quite a bit to be desired. Specifically, I the posting process into Wordpress was cumbersome at best.</p>

<h2>A New Blog Engine</h2>

<p>Like I said above, working with Wordpress and markdown was cumbersome and then some. So it was time for something new. At first I was going to use similar to <a href="https://github.com/chalupaul/chalupaul.github.io/">this</a>, which is actually what is in use on the <a href="http://openstackcookbook.com/">openstackcookbook.com</a> site. It has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Posts are written in Markdown</li>
<li>Integrated with gh-pages</li>
<li>Straighforward publishing process <code>git push origin master</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It was <em>almost</em> what I needed. In the end I went with <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/">Hugo</a>. What Hugo added was some pluggable themes and templates. Also the ability to run locally before pushing to github.</p>

<h2>Current Workflow</h2>

<p>My current workflow needed some help then. I kept the same sublime text plugins, that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>MarkdownEditing

<ul>
<li>This has a number of really handy keyboard bindings. It also has some decent highlighting and what not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Markdown Preview

<ul>
<li>This one allows me to go from Markdown into what itâ€™ll look like on the web.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Markdown TOC

<ul>
<li>This lets me go from a basic set of sections and files into a more full fledged table of contents.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, to create a new post, I modified the Rakefile found <a href="https://github.com/chalupaul/chalupaul.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Rakefile">here</a>, to look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">require &#39;fileutils&#39;
task :post do
    title = ENV[&#39;title&#39;] || &quot;new-post&quot;
    tags = ENV[&#39;tags&#39;] || &#39;&#39;
    make_img_dir = ENV[&#39;imgdir&#39;] || false
    date = (ENV[&#39;date&#39;] ? Time.parse(ENV[&#39;date&#39;]) : Time.now).strftime(&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;)
    filename = File.join(&#39;.&#39;, &quot;#{Time.now.strftime(&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;)}-#{title.strip.gsub(&#39; &#39;, &#39;-&#39;).gsub(/[^\w-]/, &#39;&#39;)}.md&quot;)
    open(filename, &#39;w&#39;) do |post|
        post.puts &quot;---&quot;
        post.puts &quot;title: \&quot;#{title}\&quot;&quot;
        post.puts &quot;date: #{Time.now.strftime(&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;)}&quot;
        post.puts &quot;categories: &quot;
        post.puts &quot;---&quot;
        post.puts &quot;\nYour content here.&quot;
        if make_img_dir
            img_dir = File.basename(filename.chomp(File.extname(filename)))
            FileUtils.mkdir_p(&quot;../images/posts/#{img_dir}&quot;)
            post.puts &quot;\n&quot; * 5
            post.puts &quot;[imgdir]: /images/posts/#{img_dir}/&quot;
        end
    end
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>So creating a new post goes like this:
bunchc: blog/content/posts$ rake post title=&quot;Title Here&quot;</p>

<p>In turn, that creates a YYYY-MM-DD-Title-Here.md file for editing in sublime. It also adds the metadata section at the top of the file for me:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">---
title: &quot;Updated Blog / Markdown workflow&quot;
date: 2014-08-14
categories: 
---
</code></pre></div>
<p>From there, I write the file, save the file, and run <code>./deploy.sh</code> from the Hugo installer linked earlier. That handles all the pushing and bits to git.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The gist of it is, Wordpress was a bit much and a bit heavy for what I needed. Hugo, Markdown, and GitHub Pages gave me a streamlined process that looks decent for posting.</p>
