<p>You may or may not know that Razor, the bare-metal lifecycle tool, has forked from its original bits. This is a good thing, but it&#39;s still really early days on the new forks, so we&#39;ll see ultimately what plays out.</p>

<p>The Puppet-Labs &quot;Razor-Server&quot; fork can be found <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server">here</a>. If you want to work with it, or test it locally, you can use the bits written by Egle <a href="http://anystacker.com/2014/01/vagrant-up-razor-server/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hanlon, the CSC fork <a href="https://github.com/csc/Hanlon">here</a>, is being perused by Tom McSweeney who helped get the original razor off the ground.</p>

<p>To help me work with it and contribute some, I&#39;ve built a small Vagrant environment (largely basd on the Vagrant environment for &#39;the other&#39; razor.).</p>

<h2>Vagrant Up Hanlon</h2>

<p>To get started, clone the repo and vagrant up, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">git clone https://github.com/bunchc/vagrant-hanlon.git
cd vagrant-hanlon
vagrant up
</code></pre></div>
<p>What this does during the vagrant up process is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install dnsmasq</li>
<li>Configure IPtables for NAT</li>
<li>Installs Mongodb</li>
<li>Installs Java</li>
<li>Installs RBENV</li>
<li>Installs both jruby and ruby 1.9.3</li>
<li>Downloads Hanlon</li>
<li>Starts Puma (to run Hanlon)</li>
<li>Pulls down a few images to add to Hanlon</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have Hanlon running, command wise it works very similar to the old Razor. That is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">hanlon node
hanlon policy
hanlon image
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, you cloned and started to work with Hanlon, one of the derivatives of the Razor bare-metal provisioning framework.</p>
