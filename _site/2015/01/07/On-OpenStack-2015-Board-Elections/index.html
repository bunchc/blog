<p>Sometime back in November, I received an email stating that I had been nominated, by the OpenStack community, to run for an Individual Board Member position. It was very shortly thereafter I had the 10 needed nominations to get on the ballot. I was super excited at the prospect, and am super humbled that I&#39;d even be considered.</p>

<p>Let me say that again. I am incredibly humbled that the community reached out and hopped on to support my nomination.</p>

<p>I repeat that, because at this time, I&#39;m deciding to back out of the election for two reasons. First and foremost, family considerations. Due to unforeseen family circumstances, I need to take a few steps back from the various things I am involved in for a while.</p>

<p>My second reason for backing out, is the entry of <a href="http://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/3106">Egle</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/eglute">@eglute</a> | <a href="http://anystacker.com/">AnyStacker</a>) into the elections. Having worked closely with Egle on a number of workshops, books, and work projects over the last few years, I can say that y&#39;all will be in great hands if she&#39;s elected.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your all your support. Mayhaps next time.</p>
