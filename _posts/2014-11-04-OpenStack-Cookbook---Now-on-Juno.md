With the summit this week, I feel it's appropriate to announce that the [scripts supporting the OpenStack Cookbook](https://github.com/openstackcookbook/openstackcookbook/tree/juno) have been updated (and are mostly functional) on OpenStack Juno.

To get started with them, you'll need either VMware Workstation/Fusion or Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/openstackcookbook/openstackcookbook -b juno
cd openstackcookbook
vagrant up
```

These scripts will be updated and expanded once again as we being writing on the third edition of the OpenStack Cookbook.
