![Asking for NSX Help](https://i.imgur.com/ACiPmzW.png)

Community is a wonderful thing. Just today I needed to learn all I could about NSX. The goal was to become an NSX "Expert" by Monday. NSX is a bit too complex for that, but, when asked, the community responded with plenty of links and suggestions. What follows here are a pile of links and my rough plan of attack.

## Video Resources

While I'm sure there are more out there, I plan to start with the #vBrownBag NSX series by Tim Davis ([@ALDTD](https://twitter.com/aldtd)). There are 3 pretty intense videos in the series:

* [NSX Component Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPax2KTQzpA&feature=youtu.be)
* [NSX Edge Gateway & Distributed Firewall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR5s61uC-vY&feature=youtu.be)
* [NSX Switching and Routing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxvRt_Li7GA&feature=youtu.be)

## Blog Resources

* [NSX Study Guide](http://www.virtually-limitless.com/vcix-nv-study-guide/)

There are a huge number of guides here, but they are comprehensive.

* [VMware Hands On Labs](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/catalog/681)

You will need to search for NSX specific labs. Recommended was getting started and then working as best as you could along with the study guides linked prior.

* [VMware Validated Design](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/software-defined-datacenter/validated-designs.html)

Validated Reference Designs for NSX

* [NSX Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-for-vSphere/index.html)

When all else fails check the docs.

* [NSX Community Forum](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/nsx)

When the docs fail, check the communities forums.
