A while back I did a cleanse of the gists I had collected on github. One of the unfortunate side-effects of this, was that I lost some post content. Apologies.

The biggest one that went missing was the userdata script I use on Ubuntu servers. Here it is, updated, and with some additions for better firewalling / logging and the like. Shoot me a note on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cody_bunch) with any questions or comments.
