In working through a few iterations of what I'm now calling the #vSensei mentorship program, a number of common themes have come up. One of those is reading. Lots and lots of it, in fact. What follows here are the most common recommendations reading I give, some general, some not so general.

## General

In here fall books for finding time, getting moving, working on bigger ideas, and the like.

- [Book of Awesome](https://gumroad.com/l/RBfO)
- [From Zero to One](http://amzn.to/1F2BWnY)
- [4-Hour work week](http://amzn.to/1F2BXsf)
- [Rise](http://amzn.to/1Kq5MmM)
- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://amzn.to/1Kq5JHs)
- [Modern Guerrilla Warfare](http://amzn.to/1iwjp9A)

A note on that last one: It is neither self-help, nor management, nor ideas. Rather, a massive tome on tactics and counter tactics used in Guerrilla warfare. It's huge, uses more formal English, and is awesome for extrapolating ideas out and into your day to day operations, be they startup, or career specific.

## Design Related

One of the common themes encountered as part of the #vSensei program has been that of "I would like to become $x" where $x is some flavor of architect, vcdx, or similar. The books here, aren't technology specific. Rather, they are to help you open your mind to thinking about how things are designed. This helps for building products to building supportable, rugged infrastructures, that will actually be used:

- [Design of Everyday Things](http://amzn.to/1MbVvtM)
- [Design Thinking](http://amzn.to/1F2ClHh)
- [The Systems Bible](http://amzn.to/1Kq6RuA)
- [The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'](http://amzn.to/1LyfEr7)

## Quazi Technical

These two both talk process, improvement, and the like. One being much more technical than the other:

- [The Phoenix Project](http://amzn.to/1F2CzhB)
- [Continuous Delivery](http://amzn.to/1gr59x3)

## Summary

This is the start of what should be an ever growing book list.
