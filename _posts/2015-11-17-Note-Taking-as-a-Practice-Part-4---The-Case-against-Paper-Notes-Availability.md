Now that we're down this rabbit hole, and we've talked about whether or not one should take notes ([you should](http://blog.codybunch.com/2015/11/04/Note-Taking-as-a-Professional-Practice-Part-1---Down-the-Rabbit-Hole/)). Now we make the case for pen & paper notes.

>As a reminder, part of my dissecting how notes are used, I'm actively going down each of these paths as well. That is, for paper notes, I'm trying a bunch of different methods, papers, pens. For e-notes I'm also using the tools and techniques we talk about.

## The Case Against Paper Notes

The case or cases against paper notes generally fall into a variant of three camps: Availability, Accessibility, and Search. These are super high level, and cover things like "My handwriting sucks" and similar. The rest of this post will concern itself with Availability.

### Availability

Availability in this context generally means: Will I have a notebook and pen handy when and if I need it. Notebooks aren't really a fashion accessory, and those that are pocket sized can struggle to capture the truly big ideas.

The routine I've fallen into whilst digging into note taking, has been to carry one of three depending on context:

- Work: ["Laboratory Notebook" from Scientific Notebook Company](http://amzn.to/1MQLPXw)
- Personal: This is one of a few as I try them out:
    + [Baron Fig Confidant](http://www.baronfig.com/pages/confidant)
    + [Starwars Moleskine](http://amzn.to/1MQM6JT)
- EDC (The go everywhere notebook): [Field Notes Expedition](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/expedition/)

"Cumbersome as heck, no? I could just tap all the notes into a smart phone, you're not selling me very well."

I'll give you that. It also took quite a while to build the actual habit too. That is, it's another set of things, in addition the cell phone and wallet to remember to bring. The way I've taken to doing it however, works something like this:

1) Field Notes ship in packs of 3. I keep one in the car. One in or with my bicycle stuff, and one as a floater. Each of these has a Pen with it, and is good for spur of the moment things, like plate numbers, or how many deer were on the route today.

This doesn't solve available everywhere, but it's good for get something out of my head and on to paper quickly. From there it moves into one of the bigger notebooks, depending on context:

2) The Laboratory Notebook, is generally kept wherever work is being done. For the most part that means it lives at the office. It's graph ruled, perfect for making diagrams and all that. It comes home on WFH days, if I remember.

3) The Personal notebook (Currently a Baba Fett Moleskine), lives in and around the house. What goes in it? Everything. At the moment, that is sort of meta: Notes on Note Taking. Blog Post Ideas, short fiction, and various other studies.

## Summary

What we tried to do here, wasn't convince you one way or the other on how you should take notes. Rather we looked at one of the arguments against paper notes and some strategies I use to work around these short comings.
