While I want this to be another long rambling post, I'm not sure that's not well suited this time around.

**Disclaimer:** This one goes a bit sideways from the usual #vSensei, or technical posts. However, I do a thing here, that I think might be useful to others, so... well that's it.

When it comes to Multiple Sclerosis, or other chronic disorders, having a conversation with your doctor can be odd. IF you go monthly, quarterly, or every 6 months, remembering how you have faired, what things happened, and so forth, can be difficult. At least, it is for us. That is, I can't remember what I had for breakfast today unless I write it down (even then, not really).

Given that, as the MS is back, keeping a journal or log of some sort is starting to be an important part of things for a number of reasons:

- It lets us communicate more effectively with *all* the doctors.
- It provides a quasi objective way to track if things are better or worse over time.
- Recording non-quantifiable info: What "good thing"â„¢ happened today, how you felt, etc, can help when and if the brain fog sets in.

The template is kept [here.](https://github.com/bunchc/MS_Journal) It's a simple markdown file. My process is to copy it each time, date stamp it, add the relevant info, and save it.

It is lovingly adapted from The Wahls Diary, ["The Wahls Protocol"](http://www.amazon.com/Wahls-Protocol-Autoimmune-Conditions-Principles/dp/1583335544/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446745801&sr=8-1&keywords=wahls+protocol) pg. 80
