Having done some work around OpenStack and Security, and even spoken in a prior summit, I'm always interested to see how many InfoSec sessions get accepted and what the various topics are.

This time around I am really excited, not so much by the quantity, but by the content and direction folks are thinking. Take a look over some of these sessions:

- [OpenStack Security the CI/CD Way](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/4637d23869682eb21a8a2d373797acc6?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- [Security enforcement, from image to production](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/80310090869c48645032d02ee8c62daf?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- [Securing the Codebase](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/b05c4706adb77469da6fd4110271e669?iframe=no&w=i:100;&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- [Detecting attacks in the cloud](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/5d48836f91ec1c9d0cbf55147c2f5b10?iframe=no&w=i:100;&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- [Lockdown: Building the worlds most secure OpenStack Cloud](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/ddf6449e0d5790c0674080b2443858c9?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- [Security through community](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/316eca92362b550347c8d1671ec1c726?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no)

The first two address, or begin to anyways, what happens to security as one moves to an agile / devops / deploy to production all the time style world. The next one addresses hardening and security OpenStack at the source code level. 

Following that, a session addressing detection, which has long needed some vision. Finally, the last two by Rob Clark look like they'll drive home the points made in the others.

There are plenty [more security related sessions](https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/overview/type/cloud+security?iframe=yes&w=i:0;&sidebar=yes&bg=no) at this summit as well.
