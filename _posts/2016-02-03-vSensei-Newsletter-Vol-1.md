Over the last little while, I've been running a sort of Ad-Hoc mentorship program, which to my surprise, is now becoming a bit more serious. While still not formal by any-means, we now have a monthly newsletter. (In case you haven't yet, you can sign up here for the vSensei newsletter.)

The plan at this stage then, is to publish the prior month's newsletter as the current month goes live. That is, if you're not a member, you can still find all but the most current newsletter on this site.

What follows then, is the Janurary edition of the newsletter for public consumption.

It's an email newsletter Charlie Brown.

I suppose with that begins the vSensei newsletter.

# What to Expect

This first one, I suspect, will be unlike those that follow. That is, this time around, one should do some expectation setting. That is, what can one expect from this newsletter, who we are, and all that.

## What to Expect from the Newsletter

As stated prior, this time around, expect introductions and logistics. Going forward, I suspect we'll send one of these monthly, and it'll include various writings from one of the vSensei mentors in the program. These will cover a variety of "soft skill" areas: How to talk to bosses, Professional writing, transitions, and others.

The newsletter will also contain announcements of upcoming vSensei enrolments, webinars, live events, and the occasional survey.

## What to expect from vSensei

Other than bad spelling, grammar, and terrible copy writing, the vSensei is a grass roots effort to build a mentorship practice within the IT practice. As explained to the first few rounds of folks, for the most part, I'm (and to a larger extent we're) making this up as we go. That is, expect it to be organic, rough around the edges, and the like.

The "Big Picture", is to eventually turn this into a large, pay it forward, style thing, whether that means 'mastermind' groups, or something that looks like an MLM scheme (or even if that's the route it will go) remains to be seen. Your thoughts, ideas, wishes, wants, and dreams will go a long way to shaping that.

# Introductions

So now the introductions! In no particular order:

(That's me)

Me, I do things. I’ve published a few books, I’ve worked with others to help them get down that path. I’ve spoken at some events, and again, have helped some others down that path. I helped start a podcast, which in turn has helped some folks take that next step. I also want to do more.
