Day number 2, Day number 2! He touched the cloud!

## #vBrownBag Day 2
Day number 2 had a number of awesome #vBrownBag tech talks, one can find that playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaZf13iWhwnBdpIkrEmHLbA).

## ZeroVM Sessions

We had a mini track going yesterday afternoon starting at 3:40 with [Carina C. Zona](http://cczona.com/) kicking it off with "Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick 3". The 4:40 session right on the heels was a 90minute hands on workshop with ZeroCloud, or that sweet spot where ZeroVM meets OpenStack Swift. The recordings / slides for these are not yet available however. If you would like to try your hands at the workshop, you should be able to with the info from [here](http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2014-10-29-Paris-Summit-Preparation/).
