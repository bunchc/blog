Oh Oh Oh! The lesson in book writing is that it is both terrible and addictive. That is, right as we wrapped the second edition of the OpenStack Cookbook, I promised myself "Never again!".

Now, some number of months later, [Kevin](https://twitter.com/itarchitectkev) and myself, we've chatted a bit, and have decided to go down that road to update the book again. Indeed, we're also looking at bringing [Egle](https://twitter.com/eglute) along for the ride this time.

## 3rd Edition Highlights

The third edition will target either a late Juno or early Kilo release (Hooray Relevancy!). In addition to general updates, were adding or overhauling the following:

- OpenStack Datacenter Automation
- OpenStack Scaling
- Image Management & Conversion
- More Operations Recipes
- HTTPS!
- OpenStack Heat
- Additional Neutron Services (LBaaS, VPNaaS)
- Using 3rd Party drivers
