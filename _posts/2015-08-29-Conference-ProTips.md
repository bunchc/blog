This started as a series of VMworld protips, however, they apply equally well to most tech conferenes. These are pulled directly from my tweet stream, without much in the way of context:

- #VMworld ProTip: Lost gadgets happen. Put some contact info on your backgrounds: [http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/iphoneandipodtouchapps/ss/Wallpaper.htm](http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/iphoneandipodtouchapps/ss/Wallpaper.htm) be prepared to remote wipe.
- #VMworld ProTip #24: Netflix, Spotify, etc... don't be that dude on the wifi...
- Nigel Hickey ‏@vCenterNerd: #VMworld ProTip #769: Get your spouse/partner setup with @spousetivities. Don't lock them up in the hotel, please. Let them explore too!
- #VMworld ProTip #25: USPS "If it fits it ships" boxes are your friends on the return trip.
- #VMworld ProTip #47: Everyone has a plan till they show up. Schedule works as a high level guide, but VMworld happens.
- #VMworld ProTip #94: No, that isn't a free wifi network. Tunnel like a mofo.

- #VMworld ProTip #52: The community has a lot of micro-celebs. Don't be afraid to introduce yourself to that blogger you've followed for ever
- #VMworld ProTip #32: On the people part, meet, connect, and follow-up with at least three. Build your own micro-community.
- #VMworld ProTip #31: Everyone there knows something you don't. The inverse is also true. /Help/ people.
- #VMworld ProTip #92: Pace yourself, and make time for yourself. Go for a walk or nap if you need to get away.
- #VMworld ProTips? ProTip #48 - Bring cough / vitamin C drops. You will need them.
