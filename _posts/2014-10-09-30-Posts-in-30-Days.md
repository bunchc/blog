I found this morning I was in a bit of a blogging slump. That is, I'd not posted anything in quite a while, even though I have plenty of exciting things going on at the moment. So, with that said, happening across [this post](http://etherealmind.com/challenge-30-blogs-30-days/) by Greg Ferro ([@etherealmind](http://twitter.com/@etherealmind)), I thought I'd jump into the fray.

I encourage you to do the same.
