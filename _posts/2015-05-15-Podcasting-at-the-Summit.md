Each summit seems to get a bit bigger, a bit better, at least in terms of podcasting. This year, there is apparently quite a line up headed to Vancouver:

- [#vBrownbag Tech Talks](http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalks-at-vancouver-summitthe-schedule/).f
- [OSPod](http://www.nextcast.net/openstackpod/)
- [The Cube](http://www.siliconangle.tv/)

There are also rumors that [The Cloudcast](http://www.thecloudcast.net/) will be there.
