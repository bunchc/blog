Hooray! I managed to get from the airport to the hotel without getting lost, and/or dead. That has to be a good thing, right? Once in the hotel, knocked out registration. It was quick and painless, however I imagine today (Tuesday, because temporal things in blog posts can be interesting), it'll be insane just prior to the keynotes.

As it was late, and I had no desire to have a brownout during book signing today, I had dinner with the #vBrownBag crew at a French restaurant. Yes yes, French food in Tokyo. Today, today local food shall be had.

For the rest of today: Keynote, book signing, #vBrownBag, and lots of sessions.
