This last week I had the wonderful opportunity to speak at the Boston VMUG user conference as a part of both a community panel, as well as a talk on "Automation - You're doing it wrong". This post then includes the speaker notes for said session in raw form, as well as the similarly raw slides.

Automation - You're doing it wrong

Automation has been a major topic at IT conferences more or less forever. Be it batch files, PowerShell, VCO (you know, before they renamed it). We've even had movements towards automating IT workloads at scale... DevOps, etc. In this talk, we aim, not to cover whatever is the latest and greatest in tactical tools for automation. Rather, our aim is to equip you with the mental models to help resolve some of the underlying issues that prevent IT teams from achieving the goal of having a more automated system, by approaching the problem with a different mindset.

Think *The Matrix* with less special effects and more pissed off System Administrators" - Joseph Bironas, Google SRE
