<p>It&rsquo;s the holidays WOOOOO! Well, maybe no seven O&rsquo;s woo, but still, a good time nevertheless. On the Zen moments thing, about 6 years ago, my father told me <a href="http://commuteorlando.com/wordpress/2009/02/03/a-zen-master-asks-why-ride-a-bicycle/">this story</a>, and designed the sticker you see above.</p>

<p>The story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five students of a Zen master was back from the market on their bicycles. As they dismounted, their master asked: &ldquo;Why are you riding your bicycles?”</p>

<p>Each of them came up with different answers to their master’s query.</p>

<p>The first student said: “It is the bicycle that is carrying the sack of potatoes. I am glad that my back has escaped the pain of bearing the weight.”</p>

<p>The master was glad and said: ”You are a smart boy. When you become old you will be saved of a hunch back unlike me.”</p>

<p>The second student had a different answer: ”I love to have my eyes over the trees and the sprawling fields as I go riding.”</p>

<p>The teacher commended: “You have your eyes open and you see the world.”</p>

<p>The third disciple came up with yet a different answer: ”When I ride I am content to chant ‘nam myoho renge kyo’”</p>

<p>The master spoke words of appreciation: ”Your mind will roll with ease like a newly trued wheel.”</p>

<p>The fourth disciple said: “Riding my bicycle I live in perfect harmony of things.”</p>

<p>The pleased master said: ”You are actually riding the golden path of non-harming or non violence.”</p>

<p>The fifth student said: ”I ride my bicycle to ride my bicycle.”</p>

<p>The master walked up to him and sat at his feet and said: “I am your disciple!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having ridden a bicycle for a number of years, I have used it for various means and in various phases. Weight-loss, transportation, racing, harmony with nature, etc. However, over the last several years through varied events, dramas and the like, I have learned that in cycling: &ldquo;I ride because I ride&rdquo;.</p>

<p>During the holidays, one can get caught up in the presents, people, dramas, and the ever present exhaustion of well, the holidays. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve been in all of the above situations and then some. This year, like in cycling, I am trying to &ldquo;Holidays because I Holidays&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Regardless of how, what, or why you get together this season, try to take a moment, sit back and enjoy them as much as you can.</p>

<p>If you also ride because you ride, and would like a sticker, either email me (bunchc at gmail) or ping me on twitter and we can arrange something.</p>
