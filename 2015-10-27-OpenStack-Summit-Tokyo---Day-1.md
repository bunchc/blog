Day number 1, or my second day in Tokyo started a bit early, but, that worked out well, as I managed to get a good feel for the city by taking a quick job around:

Booksignings I've done in the past have lasted 10-15 minutes, and generally ran through a few hundred books in that time. This time we came prepared, with what feels like 500+ books each day of the summit:
